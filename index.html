                        Hi, my name is FLOREBELLE ANTONIO LIBONA  21, years old  I live in Brgy: Nueva Invencion Barotac Viejo Iloilo 
                        I Graduated High school in BVNHS ( BAROTAC VIEJO NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL)  and now Im taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Iloilo Science and Technology University Barotac Nuevo Campus,Jalaud Barotac Nuevo Iloilo.
                        Technology is something I have been passionate about. The attraction for technology field is that technology has never failed to surprise me and grow my passion everyday more for it. I have been in the exact generation where I will be able to preserve up with and observe the impact of technology on the world. "Fields to be changed according to the course" skills but also assist me in achieving my goal of
                        becoming an Programmer. It is very funny of my "goal" but the bible verse says ' Nothing is Impossible with God' (Luke 1:37). I always  pray with God  that someday I  will achieve my Goal in Life.
                        For my skills I know how to Assemble and Disassemble the system unit because during senior high my teacher teaches us that's why I know how to do it,
                        its very hard and dangerous but Its part of the performance and you need to accept that, and i know Prototyping, Web Design, UI/UX Design. I am not those person who is very knowledgeable in this course and talented enough, But I try my best  so I can match them someday.
